  summary: The flexible collision library (FCL) is a library for performing proximity queries.
  description: |
    FCL is a library for performing three types of proximity queries on a pair of geometric models composed of triangles.

    - Collision detection: detecting whether the two models overlap, and
      optionally, all of the triangles that overlap.
    - Distance computation: computing the minimum distance between a pair of
      models, i.e., the distance between the closest pair of points.
    - Tolerance verification: determining whether two models are closer or
      farther than a tolerance distance.
    - Continuous collision detection: detecting whether the two moving
      models overlap during the movement, and optionally, the time of
      contact.
    - Contact information: for collision detection and continuous collision
      detection, the contact information (including contact normals and
      contact points) can be returned optionally.
